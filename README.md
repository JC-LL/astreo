# astreo
Astreo is an Abstract Syntax Description Language (ASDL), inspired by Andrew Appel [Zephyr ASDL](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/asdl97.pdf), published in 1997.

Just like context-free grammars can be viewed as describing the structure of a concrete parse tree, Astreo (and other ASDLs) describes the structure of *abstract* syntax trees.

In the Greec Mythology, Astreo(s) is Zephyr father, but in my case, Zephyr has clearly preceded Astreo !
It was too tempting to use Astreo name as all of this relates to *Abstract Syntax Trees* found in compilers.
