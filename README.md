# astreo
Astreo is an Abstract Syntax Description Language (ASDL), inspired by Appel Zephyr ASDL, published in 1997.

[Zephyr ASDL](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/asdl97.pdf)

In the Greec Mythology, Astreo(s) is Zephyr father, but in my case, Zephyr has clearly preceded Astreo !
It was too tempting to use Astreo name as all of this relates to *Abstract Syntax Trees* found in compilers.
